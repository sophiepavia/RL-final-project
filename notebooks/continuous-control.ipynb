    "In this notebook I will demonstrate using three RL methods on two different OpenAI environments with continuous action and observation spaces. I provide the tools to train a model and evaluate a method in terms of performance, sample efficiency, method specific criteria, and robustness. This notebook will feature a single algorithm on both environments however the github repo contains all the necessary code to run the two other algorithms. "
